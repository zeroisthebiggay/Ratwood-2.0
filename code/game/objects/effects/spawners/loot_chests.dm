/*
* these chests roll a semi-randomized number of loot objects from their tables. based on paxilloot ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ
* you can mix and match lootspawners but the dice roll will spawn from each in the list. meaning if your loot_weighted_list
* has lots of entries the loot_spawn_dice_string should be small or you'll create giant client murdering piles of stuff
*
* in addition to using these prebakes you can use varediting either as a mapper or as an admin to change the loot_weighted_list and
* loot_spawn_dice_string, among other things like lock strength and integrity, to tweak them to your needs. remember that if you plan
* to use a variant a lot, it's a little more performant to add a prebake for it here.
